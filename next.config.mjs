Edit
I see your package.json and GitHub Actions workflow file. There are a few adjustments needed to make your Next.js project deploy correctly to GitHub Pages. Let me help you set these up:

1. Let's fix your package.json and workflow file:
First, you need to update your next.config.js file to properly configure Next.js for static export:


Next.js Configuration for GitHub Pages
Code 
2. Fix your GitHub Actions workflow file:

Updated GitHub Actions Workflow
Code 
3. Fix the date-fns dependency conflict:
You have two options to resolve the date-fns conflict:

The --legacy-peer-deps flag in the workflow above should handle this.
Alternatively, you could modify your package.json to downgrade date-fns:

Fix for date-fns in package.json
Code 
4. Set up environment variables:
Create a .env.local file (for local development):


Environment Variables Configuration
Code 
Implementation Steps:
Add the next.config.js file to your project root
Replace the .github/workflows/deploy.yml file with the updated workflow
Make sure your repository settings have GitHub Pages enabled:
Go to your repository → Settings → Pages
Source should be set to "GitHub Actions"
Once you push these changes to your GitHub repository, the workflow should automatically run and deploy your site to GitHub Pages.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have questions about any part of this setup!







/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  // Replace 'arjun-portfolio' with your actual repository name
  basePath: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH || '',
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
  // This helps with relative paths in exported static files
  assetPrefix: './',
  // Add this to resolve the date-fns conflict if needed
  transpilePackages: ['react-day-picker']
}

module.exports = nextConfig
